# Use a QR code to sign-in to the Outlook mobile apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This Microsoft 365 feature is in public preview. Public preview provides early access to Microsoft 365 features.

As the Microsoft 365 administrator, you can enable your users to sign in to Outlook for Android or iOS app on their mobile devices without having to enter their username and password. By scanning a QR code, users can securely authenticate and sign in to Outlook mobile.

In Outlook on the web or other desktop Outlook applications, users may see notifications informing them that they can use Outlook on their mobile device. These notifications can be managed by the administrator using Exchange Powershell. If users choose to send themselves an SMS text message to download the app on their mobile device, a QR code will appear on their computer. They will be able to scan the QR code to log into Outlook on their phone or tablet. This QR code is a short lived token that can only be redeemed once.

> [!NOTE]
> In some cases, your users will have to re-authenticate on their computer to generate the QR code.

## Use Exchange PowerShell

This experience is on by default. To disable this feature, follow the steps below.

1. [Connect to Exchange PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/exchange/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps).
2. Using PowerShell, you can disable the notifications informing your users about the Outlook mobile apps. This will also prevent the QR code sign-in flow from being shown.

```powershell
Set-OrganizationConfig -MobileAppEducationEnabled <Boolean>
```
